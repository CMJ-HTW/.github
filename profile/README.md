## 📜 Mission
We connect two worlds: the experience of classic computing and the innovation of modern technology. Our community restores, adapts, and experiments with vintage systems, creating a platform where traditional knowledge meets new approaches. Here, each side brings unique strengths—precision, creativity, problem-solving—to build something greater than either could alone.

## 🎯 Vision
We create spaces where:
- Expertise in legacy tech informs and enhances modern projects
- Contemporary skills breathe new life into previous systems
- Collaboration between different perspectives drives unexpected solutions and ideas

**Our purpose is to link these worlds, turning differences into opportunities for learning, creation, and progress.**

## 📂 Repository Overview

### 🔄 CRUD Software Database
This section includes all database and software components for managing our digital collections. We maintain records for each exhibit, from specifications and historical significance to condition reports and media.

- **Goal**: Simplify the management of our growing collection with efficient CRUD operations for creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.

### 📦 Asset Manager
The Asset Manager is designed to help us keep track of our physical and digital assets, including restored computers, peripherals, documentation, and more. This tool is crucial for managing inventory, planning restorations, and ensuring our exhibits are always ready for display.

- **Goal**: Streamline our asset management to support restoration and exhibit planning.
